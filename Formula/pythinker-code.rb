  # The bundled @opentui prebuilt dylib has no Mach-O headerpad space, so
  # brew's install-linkage fixup prints a non-fatal "Failed changing dylib ID"
  # warning. The library is loaded by absolute path at runtime; the install
  # works. Upstream fix requires OpenTUI to link with -headerpad_max_install_names.

    <<~EOS
      During install, Homebrew may print a non-fatal warning:
        "Failed changing dylib ID of .../libopentui.dylib"
      This is expected (a prebuilt library without Mach-O headerpad space)
      and does not affect functionality.
